      <p> My name is Hosay Rahim and I was born in Afghanistan. I came to England in 2005 in search of a better life. Living in the England has had its own challenges. I went to school for a year before I joined college. The one year of school was tough and depressing and getting bullied made it even worst. However soon after, I moved to college and did a Btec diploma in Applied science along with GCSE English and Mathematics.

        I can speak multiple languages such as English, Dari, Urdu, Hindi, Pashto and Farsi. I love travelling and meeting new people from different cultures and backgrounds. One of my biggest dreams is for my country of birth (Afghanistan) to be peaceful again so I can travel and visit all the beautiful provinces.

        Afghanistan is is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of Central and South Asia. Referred to as the "Heart of Asia", it is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, Tajikistan to the northeast, and China to the northeast and east. Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominately mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest, which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range. As of 2021, its population is 40.2 million, composed mostly of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Kabul is the country's largest city and serves as its capital.

        Afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces. The provinces of Afghanistan are the primary administrative division. Each province encompasses a number of districts or usually over 1,000 villages. Each province of Afghanistan has its own beauty and can be an interesting country to visit for the tourists as it offers a lot of beauty, history and diversity. But unfortunately it is not a safe country to visit.

        As a child growing up, I was always curious to know more about computers and wanted to pursue my degree in that field too. However due to some life challenges I ended up doing Biomedical Science at the University of Hull and after studying three year I got graduated in 2015. I been through a lot of difficulties to find a job, in fact I wasted one year to look for trainee positions but couldnâ€™t. Eventually I found a temporary support worker job at the NHS which then turned to permenant after a few months. I have recently managed to complete my portfolio and become a Biomedical Scientist. But my dream of studying and working in web developing and IT has always been there. I often wish I could managed to leave my full time job and concentrate on fulfilling my dream but life and responsibilities has always taken priority.

        Over the years I have been watching YouTube videos etc to learn about web developing etc. I am extremely excited and looking forward to do the course with CodeYourFuture and fulfil my life long dream. Below is one the Youtube videos that I have recently watched.
